#Using argparse library , take 2 inputs n and w for board_size and win resp.

# Getting started
#z is n*n square matrix containing all zeros, created using mat function 
#add two 2's at random position 

# Working of game 
#Take key input using keyboard library
#main function contains all 4 shifts up,down,left,right
#after every move, add 2 at position containing zero using add_two function
#print result using display function after every move 

# Result of game
#win or lose is checked using game_state function

#keyboard library is used so that after every key input, no need to press enter
#as keboard.read_only() works very fast, there is time.sleep() of 1 sec.
